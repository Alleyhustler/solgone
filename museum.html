        <p>History: The Spectrum built on the success of the predecessor ZX81 machine, launching in April 1982, and
          within a year, it had sold close to a million units, despite early production problems and lengthy waiting
          lists. The hardware was largely devised by Richard Altwasser, with the software and manual provided by John
          Grant and Steve Vickers of the local company Nine Tiles. <a

        <p>My story: My very first computer. My father brought it from London along with a few cassette tapes with
          games. Can't remember when exactly, but it must have been after 1987, when I was 7 years old. I grew up in
          Hungary and new tech reached the Eastern block with several years delay. My memories include crazy long
          loading times, watching the stripes running on the screen, waiting for <a
            href="https://zxart.ee/eng/software/game/arcade/platform/manic-miner1/">Manic Miner</a>, <a

            href="https://zxart.ee/eng/software/game/arcade/platform/automania/">AutoMania</a> to load.
          I was absolutely captivated by it.</p>

        <p>History: A redesign of the original Spectrum by 1984 was long overdue, planning started in June of that year,
          and after a very short development spell it was released in October the same year. It introduced a new
          QL-style enclosure with a much needed injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button. Early on, the machine
          outsold the rubber-key model 2:1. <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/510/Sinclair-ZX-Spectrum/"

        <p>My story: One of my closest friends in school had this model (Hi Peter, if you'll ever read this) and we've
          been spending many afternoons together after school playing various games on it. Much later in adulthood, when
          my rubber keyboard Speccy started to fail, I bought a Plus because of the improved keyboard.</p>

        <p>History: The Commodore 64 was one of the most successful home computers in the world selling around 11-17
          million units between 1982 to 1993. Part of its success was due to the fact that it was sold in retail stores
          instead of electronics stores, and that Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control supplies and
          cost. <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/1336/Commodore-64/">Read more</a></p>
        <p>My story: My father worked as a radio engineer and he bought a C64 a few years after the Speccy. Later I got
          my own setup with a 1541 and lots of games. This was the time when software swapping and copy-parties were at
          it's peak. I became interested in programming on the C64 and started writing BASIC programs, but couldn't
          really get too far with it. I clicked around in GEOS, but couldn't really understand what to use it for, so I
          played a lot of games instead. Giana Sisters, Street Rod, Holiday Games, and many great Hungarian games like
          <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/game/impossible-mission">Impossible Mission</a>,
          Kastely/Castle (a dungeon crawler), <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/game/bburago-rally"
           >Bburago Rally</a> (top-down car racing ), Idoregesz/Time Explorer (text adventure). Last but
          not least one of the best movie adaptations ever: <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/game/aliens-activision"
           >Aliens</a>. I never tried <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/game/newcomer"
           >Newcomer</a>, probaby the greatest adventure game on C64 back then, so it's in my backlog.

        <p>History: The last 8-bit machine commercially released by Commodore Business Machines. It appeared three years
          after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64. The C128 was a significantly expanded successor to the
          C64 and full compatibility with it was retained. It featured a 80-column display mode, dual CPU and was
          capable of running the CP/M operating system. <a

        <p>My story: One of my friends got a C128 when I was already moving towards the Amiga. He was very much into
          programming it and was showing me some cool stuff on it. Later I managed to get a C128 myself when everybody
          was moving away from 8-bit machines and selling them, but already back then it was more as an interesting
          piece of harware to me, rather than something I would use as my main computer. The C64 mode was the one I used
          the most on it, and I guess it was not just me.</p>

        <p>History: The Amiga 500 represented a return to Commodore's roots, being sold in the same mass retail outlets
          as the Commodore 64 to which it was a spiritual successor, as opposed to the computer store-only Amiga 1000.
          The original A500 proved to be Commodore's best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe.
          Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced
          graphics and sound for the time were of significant benefit. <a
            href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/7800/Commodore-Amiga-A500/">Read more</a></p>
        <p>My story: One of my best friends had an Amiga 500 in the early 90s and I was absolutely amazed by the
          graphics and sound. We've been playing games like Superfrog, Fire and Ice, Sleepwalker, listening to music
          disks like Andromeda's Mirror and fooling around in ProTracker, making music. Check out some of the modules we
          made <a href="musicbar.html">here</a>. It was why I decided to convince my parents to buy an Amiga after the
          C64, instead of a PC. We managed to buy an Amiga 1200 however (as a family friend was selling it) and it took
          a few years before I finally added the A500 to my collection. Now it's my main retro computer system.</p>

          graphics, built-in RF modulator, more memory and expansion options, internal 2.5" Hard Drive option, PCMCIA
          slot with easy networking add-on possibility. After Commodore's demise the A1200 almost disappeared off the
          market but the system was re-launched by Escom in 1995. <a

        <p>My story: My very first Amiga computer (Commodore version) in around 1993. Back then I never had a hard
          drive, so I was mostly using it for games, trying making music, drawing some basic pixel art, learning
          Workbench 3.1, all from floppies. I've spent countless of nights with games like <a
            href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1118">Walker</a>, <a
            href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=252">Chaos Engine</a>, <a
            href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=55">Alien Breed</a>, etc. Competed
          against friends in Mortal Kombat, Street Figher, Shadow Fighter and Worms. <a
            href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">Cannon Fodder</a> was weirdly an
          experience of nature with it's lush jungles. Unfortunately a few years later, after Commodore's bankcruptcy,
          we decided to sell it and switch to PC as a family computer. Later in high school I got one again (first a
          very worn down Commodore version and later a brand new Escom Magic Pack) and this time I dived deeper into
          becoming a hard-core Amiga user, with CPU expansion boards, networking card, hard drive and of course a fully
          configured Workbench system. I've been an active member of the Hungarian Amiga Community, both online (IRC,
          mailing list and the Hungarian Amiga portal) and offline (Amiga clubs, demo parties, magazines).</p>

            <p>History: Regarded as probably the most advanced Amiga model of it's era by many. Entirely reworked to be
              a high-end workstation. New Motorola 68030 CPU, 68882 FPU, 32-bit system memory, new Zorro III expansion
              slots, DMA SCSI-II controller on board and the Enhanched Chip Set with a display enhancer to be used with
              a VGA monitor. The A3000UX variant came boundled with UNIX System V operating system.</p>
            <p>My story: I managed to get an Amiga 3000 desktop computer when I was already deeply into everything
              Amiga. Sadly my unit had some stability issues and despite all my efforts to fix it, never worked
              reliably.</p>

        <p>History: Generally similar to the A3000, but introducing the AGA chipset, newer Kickstart ROMs and replacing
          the SCSI with a lower-cost Parallell ATA (IDE) controller. The CPU was located on a CPU card and very easily
          upgradable. The most advanced of all Amigas possible (especially the Tower version with it's superior
          expandability and cooling).</p>
        <p>My story: My most high-end Amiga system, that I've been using as my main computer for many years in the late
          90s, early 2000s, until the point I moved from home. It was expanded with a CyberStorm CPU card with a
          Motorola 68060 @ 50Mhz, CyberVision 3D graphics card, X-Surf networking card, MultiFace interface card and a
          Toccata sound card. I was using it for web development, music making with DigiBooster Pro and for pretty much
          every daily computing task.</p>

        <p>History: A PowerPC motherboard based around the Marvell MV64361 "Discovery II" northbridge and VIA 8231
          southbridge, in a microATX form factor. Designed by Gerald Carda, who designed several Blizzard and Cyberstorm
          expansion boards to the Amiga. The "main" operating system is MorphOS, which is mostly backwards compatible
          with system friendly AmigaOS 3.1 applications. Since 2009, AmigaOS 4.1 also supports the board.</p>
        <p>My story: I decided to give next-gen Amiga systems a try, and as at that time AmigaOS4 and AmigaOne was not
          yet available (then was very difficult to get and had many issues), I opted for a Pegasos and MorphOS. I had
          been using a Pegasos II for a few years, mostly along with other computers. I never liked the fragmentation in
          the Amiga community however and by this time I lost my enthusiasm in next-gen Amiga hardware completely.</p>

        <p>History: Macintosh Classic II (also sold as the Performa 200) is the last black & white compact Mac. It's the
          successor of the Macintosh SE/30, but has a slower performance due to a cost-reduced 16-bit data bus. It's
          expandable to 10 MB of RAM and was supplied with either 40 or 80 MB hard disk. Architecturally it had more in
          common with the Macintosh LC, but lacked the internal Processor Direct Slot, making it the second slotless
          desktop Machintosh after the original Classic.</p>
        <p>My story: As a kid my school had two computer labs, one with IBM PCs and another with compact Macs. I liked
          the Mac lab much more as the Macs had graphical user interface and most machines had Prince of Persia,
          ShufflePuck Cafe and other fun stuff installed, which we could play during the breaks. Macintosh Classic II
          was the first system I learned using productivity software (Word processing, Spreadsheets) on, drew with
          KidPix and learned programming with Logo. I got a Classic II / Performa 200 recently, recapped and renovated
          it.</p>

        <p>History: The Radio-86RK was a build-it-yourself home computer designed in the Soviet Union, by Ham Radio
          enthusiasts. The circuitry of the Radio-86RK contains only 29 chips and was relatively easy to assemble.
          However, finding the chips to buy was difficult, as they were scarce and sold in small volumes in major cities
          of the USSR. The first industrially produced version of the Radio-86RK was the computer named Microsha. <a

        <p>History: Designed by the team of Game & Watch, Satoru Okada and Gunpei Yokoi, the Game Boy even though
          believed to be hopeless by many, started a revolution in portable gaming and became an absolute cult classic
          and an icon of the era. Bundling it together with Tetris was one of the best business decisions Nintendo ever
          made.</p>
        <p>My story: I got a Game Boy as a kid during a summer vacation. It was ideal to kill time on long travels and
          also my mother was very much into Tetris. Unfortunately games were too expensive compared to our budget (and
          to an average Eastern European salary), so I only managed to get a few games during my Game Boy ownership of
          years. My absolute favourites were Kirby's Dream Land and Nemesis/Gradius II. I got a Game Boy again recently,
          so I'm in the process of catching up with the library.</p>

        <p>History: A smaller, lighter redesign of the Game Boy Advance, the smallest handheld Nintendo ever made and
          the last in the Game Boy series. It lacks backward compatibility for original Game Boy and Game Boy Color
          cartridges. It has a metallic casing, which is unusual for Nintendo. It has an excellent backlit screen
          (comparable to the later SP models), but it's tiny in size (2 inches). It also has removable front panels for
          peronalization, but also protection of the LCD screen.</p>
        <p>My story: My son's first gaming system. I decided to buy him a GBA Micro due to several reasons. Because
          it's tiny and fits the smaller hands well, it's simplicity of controls (A/B and L/R buttons), simplicity of
          usage (no menu, just plug the game in and play), backlit screen and amazing game library. I also thought that
          it's good to start with an older system, to give some perspective on gaming history. He absolutely loves the
          Game Boy Advance Micro and is very much into pixel art and game making now. His dream is to make a GBA game

        <p>History: The second iteration of the Nintendo DS, mainly a cosmetic upgrade to the original. It's slimmer,
          brighter, and more lightweight. The screens are slightly bigger (from 76mm to 79mm) and the weight dropped
          from 275 grams to 218. The DS Lite also had a dual cartridge system, with a Game Boy slot for Game Boy Advance
          games on the bottom and a DS card slot in the top.</p>
        <p>My story: I got a DS Lite in 2011 and played through several titles on it, especially the Zelda games. We
          often played together with my wife late at night, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are shared memories.
          Bowser's Inside Story and Nanostray 2 were also among my personal favourites.</p>

        <p>History: Improvements in the NN3DS upon the previous 3DS models include upgraded processors and increased
          RAM, an analog pointing stick (C-Stick), two additional shoulder triggers (ZR and ZL), face detection for
          optimizing the autostereoscopic 3D display, an included 4 GB microSD card and built-in NFC. The web browser
          also supports HTML5 now.</p>
        <p>My story: My all time favourite handheld console with an absolutely amazing game library. I bought my first
          3DS in Japan, then later I bought our current New 3DS XL, which is a European Animal Crossing Limited Edition
          model. As I had a few games I brought from Japan, I decided to mod it so I can play them. That's the only mod
          I did on it. It's still our family's main handheld console, with many great games including The Legend of
          Zelda Majora's Mask, Link Between Worlds, Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion and Japanese titles like Hatsune
          Miku Project Mirai and Taiko no Tatsujin.</p>

        <p>History: It's codename was Dolphin (hence the emulator's name) and it was developed in partnership with IBM and ArtX,
          founded by former Silicon Graphics engineers, hoping to compete with 3DFX, but later acquired by ATI. The GameCube used
          its own format for optical disks (miniDVD based, 1.46 GB) and a memory cards. It also came with a new controller (supports 4 in parallel).
          It was mildly successful, but fall behind it's competitors likely due to the lack of support from third-party developers.
          Still, several new franchises were launched on it like Pikmin, Animal Crossing and Metroid Prime, along with such classics 
          as Super Smash Bros Melee, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, Resident Evil 4 and Zero. 
        </p>
        <p>My story: While working as a videogame journalist, I got provided with a GameCube and tested mostly kids friendly games on it,
          but completely missed out on the best of it's library. I had a GC controller for my Wii and recently wanted to compete against 
          my son in Super Smash Bros Brawl, so thought I'll buy another. But the prices for GC controllers went up so much, that it was 
          actually cheaper to buy a whole system that came with one. So now there is this and the opportunity to catch up with it's library.
          Resident Evil 4, James Bond 007: Nightfire, Ikaruga, SoulCalibur II are among the first ones I got for it. Oh, and I think the GC
          controller is the most comfortable controller ever made.

        <p>History: It's codename was Revolution and it indeed started a revolution in motion control in gaming, which
          led to the development of Microsoft Kinect and PlayStation Move. It broadened the demographics of gaming and
          attracted many casual gamers and appealed to a younger audience. Technically it's an upgraded GameCube
          hardware with backwards compatibility.</p>
        <p>My story: The game console we had for the longest and still do. It's the perfect family game system with many
          fun local multiplayer games, cute games for kids, along with more serious titles for single player gaming. We
          bought our first Wii around 2008. We actually owned a few of them over the years as with a 12V adapter and a
          12V TV it can be used even on a boat or weekend house. We still play Wii games and love them. The Legend of
          Zelda Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess are among the best of the series, Muramasa Demon Blade is a gem and
          Super Smash Bros Brawl is still one of the best local multiplayer beat'em ups. I'm also a big fan of the
          Metroid series and I consider the Metrod Prime Trilogy on the Wii as the best FPS game with motion controls.
          Another great advantage of the Wii is that collecting games is still cheap compared to other systems.</p>

        <p>History: Also known as the Sega Genesis in North America, Sega's third and most successful console, selling
          over 30 million units worldwide. The 16-bit Mega Drive was the biggest competitor of SNES and it's game
          library has quite a few games that were also present on the Amiga. Maybe due to the the same CPU porting games
          were easier between the two systems. <a href="https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Drive">Read
            more</a></p>
        <p>My story: I got my very first Mega Drive (a Mega Drive II) in the middle of the 90s, along the Amiga. I'm not
          embarrassed to admit that the main reason was Mortal Kombat II, which was not coming out on the Amiga at that
          time (and it was uncertain if it ever would). I was completely into Mortal Kombat I and II as a kid, spending
          all my pocket money in arcades with my friends, so it kind of made sense. The Mega Drive came with Sonic 2
          included though, so I've been playing those two games until I completed them several times and fell in love
          with the 2D Sonic games. I still think it's the best platform game ever. I couldn't afford any other games
          back then. Later I added a Mega Drive (I) to my collection, with the intention of exploring the very best of
          the game library I missed out on.</p>

        <p>History: Sony began developing the PlayStation after a failed venture with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM
          peripheral for the SNES in the early 1990s. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi and Sony
          Computer Entertainment in Japan and put an emphasis on 3D polygon graphics. Sony's inclusive approach to game
          production attracted many third party developers, which resulted in an excessive game library and many new
          franchises being born, including Crash Bandicoot, Gran Turismo, Spyro, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Metal Gear,
          etc.</p>
        <p>My story: I started working at the country's leading gaming magazine from the mid 90s and got to try out and
          work with most of the console systems of the time. The PSX was my favourite due to it's game library and
          presentation. My unit was a developer edition in blue color with an added debug parallel port.</p>

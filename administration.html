      <h1>Welcome to Planet Neon!</h1>
      <p>My home planet floating around in cyberspace. Here you can find various topics that interests me, including vintage
        computers like the Commodore Amiga or the Macintosh 68k, music, physical media (mainly cassette tapes and CDs), programming,
        games, game development and the earlier web.
      </p>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've been using the pseudonym <b>neongod</b> since the 90s and still think it sounds cool. It came from an old
        music module’s title I found on a computer magazine cover disk back then. Can’t find it anymore though, so
        unfortunately I've no idea who made it. I'm a software engineer, retro computer nerd, hobby gamedev and
        a dad, not necessarily in this order. I've been hanging out online and around computer geeks since my
        youth, mostly on IRC and web forums, but also IRL in computer clubs and demoscene parties.</p>

      <h2 id="aboutsite">About this site</h2>
      <p>I imagined this website as the view from your spaceship in <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier:_Elite_II">Frontier Elite II</a>, when you
        approach a planet. There are several locations to descend to, each base offers something unique. I tried to keep
        it intentionally simple and use the aestetics of the late 90s web I appreciate so much. I don't like what the Internet has become,
        where most pages look the same and as if they'd be pages from a magazine. After many years without a personal
        page, I decided to create my own site again.</p>
      <p>I find myself using vintage tech more often nowadays and longing for simpler times, when technology and the web
        were still fun. I decided to make the site by hand, like I did 20 years ago, with a text editor. It's been
        a while since I coded HTML and CSS by hand, and my goal with this is to relearn, but also to question and
        unlearn.</p>
      <h3>Under the hood</h3>
      <p>The planet neon logo uses the Cuddly bitmap font from the <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/0302aee1480c7f444dfa26008375b07b454">AmigaFonts
          package</a>. The site is using the <a href="https://github.com/rewtnull/amigafonts">Topaz
          Amiga</a> font or the Machintosh Charcoal font (if selected). For the planet graphics I used the amazing tools
        made
        by <a href="https://deep-fold.itch.io/">Deep-fold</a>, the spaceship is from Frontier Elite II,
        while for the base graphics I used Buch's and rubberduck's <a
          href="https://opengameart.org/content/colony-sim-extended-version">Colony Sim assets</a>.</p>
      <p>My original idea was to aim for HTML 2.0 to be fully compatible with old computers, as I sometimes browse the
        web from my vintage machines, but then I realized that Neocities has SSL enabled by default, which wouldn't work
        on most old
        machines anyway without a proxy.
      </p>
      <p>The main page uses CSS and JavaScript to scale the planet image and the image map, and redirect to a simple
        version in case of an old browser is detected.
        It also falls back to show a simple text menu if there is no JavaScript support.</p>
      <img src="images/netscape-ibrowse.gif">
      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <p>There are three levels of navigation. Planet -> Base -> Articles. <b>Back to Orbit</b> always takes you back to
        the main page. <b>Back to Base</b> takes you, well... back to the Base.</p>
      <p>The planet image on the main page is 1000px wide. The <a href="simple.html">simple version</a> has an 500px
        planet image, so that it fits even on old computers with a lower resolution.
      <div class="inline-content">
        <p>Main articles are indicated with red <img src="images/bullet-red.gif"></p>
        <p>Sub-sections within articles are marked with yellow <img src="images/bullet-yellow.gif"> bullets.</p>
        <p>Articles and links with a New <img src="images/new.gif"> sign mean that the article is not older than a few
          weeks.</p>
        <p>The updated <img src="images/updated.gif"> sign lets you know that the article was updated since it was
          originaly posted.</p>

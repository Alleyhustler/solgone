      <h1>The BRG MK27 portable cassette player and recorder</h1>
      <p>I found this absolute gem in my father's garage. I remember using this when I was like 6 or 7 years old. I
        thought it will be a fun project to make it work again, but then, I plugged it in and it works just fine!
        Amazing. It's from 1977 and must have been in storage for more than 30 years, but it still plays perfectly. I
        gave it a clean and now I have a portable cassette player too!</p>

      <a href="../images/collection/brgmk27_1_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/collection/brgmk27_1.jpg"></a>

      <p>BRG stands for Budapesti Radiotechnikai Gyar (Budapest Radiotechnic Factory), one of the major radio equipment
        manufacturers on the Soviet market. The MK series was intended as a portable boombox for camping, weekend
        houses, etc. The MK27 was designed in 1975 and first available for consumers in 1977. Featuring a funky,
        youngful, but slightly militaristic design, with rubber buttons. Even though it's look was controversial (some
        called it a "diver" or a "space" magnetofon), it's unique for sure and it became rather popular and widespread
        in Hungary after it's release.</p>
      </p>

      <p>It has a 0.8W power output, weights 1.3 kg and runs on batteries (5 x R14, 7.5V) and a power adapter. The tape
        mechanism is BRG's own design, simple and robust, but not without issues. Forwarding/Rewinding should be used
        carefully as it doesn't have an auto-stop function and the torque is rather strong, so if left unattended, it
        can stretch or damage the tape.</p>

      <a href="../images/collection/brgmk27_2_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/collection/brgmk27_2.jpg"></a>

      <p>There are 5 control buttons, Forward, Play, Stop/Eject, Record, Rewind, the icons on them are not easy to
        understand though, the Play button facing "up" if the unit in a lying position and the Record having an inverse
        play symbol and facing "down". It's easy to mix them up and accidentaly press Record. The player can be operated
        in both standing and lying position, all the labels however are designed to face the user in the lying position,
        except the technical label on the back.</p>

      <p>There is a power adapter plug and a 5pin DIN input connector on one side and a volume control slider on the
        other side. The handle can be removed by pressing the two big PAT buttons on the sides simultanously and pulling
        the handle out.</p>

      <a href="../images/collection/brgmk27_3_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/collection/brgmk27_3.jpg"></a>

      <p>The sound quality of the unit is what you would expect from a player of this era and segment. It's not anywhere
        near good, but it's fine for casual listening. Overall it's a very nice piece of cassette player history I would
        say and I'm happy to have it. It resides in my daughter's room now as she often listens to cassettes and
        mentioned that she would like a boombox.</p>

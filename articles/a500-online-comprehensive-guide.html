      <h1>Bringing the Amiga 500 online, the comprehensive guide</h1>

      <p>That's a bold title. There are obviously many ways to bring our beloved Amiga 500 online and I can't possibly
        cover them all in one article. What I will focus on here are the options avaialble with as stock setup of an
        Amiga 500 as possible.</p>
      <p>Before going any further, we need to clarify what do we exactly mean by online?
        Is it online like it was back in 1987 when the Amiga 500 was released or is it online like the <a
          href="#internettoday">Internet we know
          today</a>? Let's investigate both scenarios in a bit more detail.</p>

      <h2>1. Back in the day</h2>
      <p>Online meant dialing in to another computer through a <a
          href="https://toobnix.org/w/p4ZYu6LUhZXQpP7svcGVy2">modem</a> and a telephone line. Often that other machine
        was running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board System (BBS)</a>. Can
        we still do this today? In a way, yes, and I would like to argue that this is the most viable option for stock
        Amiga 500 owners.</p>

      <h3>What can this be used for?</h3>
      <p>Many fun things actually. There are old BBS servers that are online again on the telnet protocol and there are
        new ones too. There are various servers on telnet that provide fun and excitement for us geeks:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>telehack.com:23</b> for example lets you play the classic NetHack game, among many other things. You can
          even watch Star Wars Episode IV in the terminal!</li>
        <li>You can play chess on <b>freechess.org:5000</b> or Go on <b>igs.joyjoy.net:6969</b></li>
        <li>Or a Star Trek themed game on <b>mtrek.com:1701</b></li>
        <li>Gaming Museum on <b>gt.gamingmuseum.com:23</b> hosts a number of old BBS games ready to play</li>
        <li>There are numerous servers that provide text based adventure games, MUDs (Multi User Dungeon) RPG games and
          MUCKs (Multi-User Chat Kingdom) text-based role-playing games designed for social interaction. You can find a
          more comprehensive list of available servers <a
            href="https://store.chipkin.com/articles/telnet-list-of-telnet-servers">here</a> and <a
            href="http://www.mewbies.com/acute_terminal_fun_telnet_public_servers_watch_star_wars_play_games_etc.htm">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>But most importantly, check the largest list of available BBS servers on <a
            href="https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/">TelnetBBSguide.com</a>, many updated daily, have a file download
          section and an active community.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><img src="../images/atalkIII-starwars.gif"></p>

      <p>If you have an own server in your local network, you can connect to it via telnet and use command line internet
        tools there.</p>

      <p>There are so called BBS doors, which are applications that provide a connection to other machines from the
        server running the
        BBS. Nowadays there are some that offer doors to the outside Internet, so it's possible to run a
        text based web browser, IRC or email client from the terminal there. One of such is the <a
          href="https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/public-electronic-networked-information-system/">
          Public Electronic Networked Information System</a>, which despite the horrible name, works pretty well and
        provides Usenet, Gopher, IRC and WWW access. It's neither safe nor nice, but it's possible to access the
        Internet this way on very low end machines, read the news, check the weather.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/atalkIII-startrek.gif"></p>


      <h3>How to connect?</h3>

      <p>There are several ways, but they can be practically distilled into two options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Connecting the Amiga 500 to a PC via a null modem cable and use a software on the PC side to emulate a
          modem, so we can dial in to a BBS through the Internet via Telnet. AmigaLove made a <a
            href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=168&amp;sid=8745c76444d5e4e7138031eeaf3ffd94">very detailed
            guide on this</a>.</li>
        <li>Do the same thing with a hardware solution like a <a
            href="https://www.cbmstuff.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=59">WiModem232</a>. It emulates a
          Hayes compatible modem and can connect directly to your WiFi network.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I would really recommend going with the second option as even though it's a bit more expensive, it will result
        in
        a much sealmess and nice experience, closer to how it originally was, without the need of poking around with a
        PC (which has to be next to your Amiga and turned on). As I have such a modem, I'd like to elaborate a bit more
        on how to set it up.</p>

      <h3 id="wimodem232-setup">Setup the WiModem232</h3>
      <p>If you've never done this before, no need to panic, it's pretty simple and straight forward. There is also good
        <a href="https://www.cbmstuff.com/downloads/wimodem/wimodem232_manual.pdf">documentation</a> on the modem and
        how to set it up.
      </p>
      <p>First, you need to plug the modem into the serial port of your Amiga and connect a 5V USB power source to it.
        Most mobile chargers would do.</p>
      <p>Then you'll need a terminal software, I recommend A-Talk III, as it runs well from floppy, very simple to setup
        and what's even better, Marco Papa of Felsina Software made it public domain in 2010. You can grab the <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/0301eaa97b634a046b7ac18b1ba87e960fb">A-Talk III ADF here</a>, and <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/0309496d08206f8468da07093c6b189443e">the manual here</a>. Just boot a
        Workbench 1.3 floppy up, insert the A-Talk III disk and launch it.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/atalkIII.gif"></p>
      <p>The Wimodem232 by default starts in a 300 baud mode, so you'll need to set your terminal to match that. Check
        the rest of the settings in the menu to match the following:<br>
        Parity - None<br>
        Stop Bits - 1<br>
        No. Bits - 8<br>
        Handshake - RTS/CTS<br>
        Duplex - Full</p>

      <p><img src="../images/atalkIII-setup.gif"></p>

      <p>Save your settings in the Project menu.</p>

      <p>By typing the command "ati", you can check the status information of the modem:</p>

      <p><img src="../images/wimodem232-1.gif"></p>

      <p>You can set the speed to faster (baud 9600) with:</p>
      <pre>AT*B9600</pre>
      <p>Then update your terminal's baud settings to match that.</p>
      <p>You can save the default configuration of the modem with:</p>
      <pre>AT&W</pre>
      <p>So it doesn't get lost in case you reboot or unplug the WiModem232. If you'd ever want to go back to factory
        defaults, you can issue the command:</p>
      <pre>AT&F</pre>
      <p>This won't clear your address book, but it will reset everything else, and set the baud rate back to 300. There
        are also two emergency reset pads on the bottom side of the modem, so if anything would go wrong, which is
        unlikely, you can reset the modem by shorting those pads while turning the modem on.</p>
      <p>It's time to configure the connection to your WIFI router. There are several ways to do this. The modem can
        serve you a web interface where you can configure the WIFI network from your phone or tablet. To enable this
        mode, type:</p>
      <pre>AT*WIFI</pre>
      <p>Now look at your mobile device and check the WIFI list. An entry called WiModem232 should appear. Click on that
        and you can configure the modem.</p>
      <p>Another way is to do it manually from the terminal directly. Issuing the following command will list all the
        available WIFI networks:</p>
      <pre>AT*N</pre>
      <p>Then you can select the one you'd like to connect to with the following command:</p>
      <pre>AT*NS&lt;number from the list&gt;,&lt;password&gt;

Example:
AT*NS1,Password123
    </pre>
      <p>Or, you can also set your router's SSID directly, with the following command:</p>
      <pre>AT*SSID&lt;your SSID&gt;,&lt;password&gt;

Example:
AT*SSIDMYROUTER,Password123
Note: There is no space between the letters "SSID" and the router's actual SSID.</pre>
      <p>Now you're connected!</p>
      <p>You can test if your connection works by connecting a server:</p>
      <pre>ATDT &lt;server domain or ip&gt;:&lt;port number&gt;

Example:
ATDT google.com:80</pre>
      <p>You should see "CONNECTED" on the screen. To hang up the connection, press the “+” key 3 times in a row very
        quickly, it should respond with saying "OK". Then you can type the command to hang up the connection:</p>
      <pre>ATH</pre>

      <p>You can also update the firmware of the modem now, it will reboot the modem, but your settings will be kept:
      </p>
      <pre>AT*UPDATE</pre>

      <p>And that's all there is to it really! You can connect to various BBS servers now, just pick your favourite.</p>

      <h2 id="internettoday">2. Today's Internet</h2>

      <p>If by Online we mean accessing the actual Internet with applications running on our machine locally, that's a
        much more
        complicated problem and we have to awknowledge the limitations of the machine.</p>

      <p>The TCP/IP stack and all the client applications take up too much space and memory to be used from a floppy
        disk and with 1MB of RAM. Another issue is the Kickstart 1.3. When the Internet started to become more
        widespread in the 90s,
        Kickstart 2.0 was already out and most Amiga developers used its features for making network enabled OS-friendly
        applications.
        Therefore all of the more advanced TCP/IP stacks on Amiga require at least Kickstart 2.0.</p>
      <p>Besides Commodore's AS225 TCP/IP stack that came with the A2065 Zorro-II card for the Amiga 2000/3000/4000, the
        only TCP/IP stack that I'm aware of that runs on Kickstart 1.3 is <a
          href="https://theory.cs.uni-bonn.de/ppp/part5.html#amigappp">AmigaNOS (Network
          Operating System)</a>. It is a port of <a href="http://www.ka9q.net/code/ka9qnos/">KA9Q's NOS</a>, a TCP/IP
        stack made for amateur packet radio systems. It should work on an Amiga 500 with 1Mb RAM and two floppy drives
        (to skip frequent disk swapping), it supports SLIP/PPP, but none of the more "modern" internet applications will
        work with it, as it doesn't have a complete bsdsocket.library emulation.</p>
      <p>It has it's own
        command-line interface and you can use a few command-line applications like telnet, ftp, smtp, pop3 there. There
        isn't much documentation on it online, I only found <a
          href="http://web.tiscalinet.it/iw2fer/a500_nosconf_eng.htm">this one page</a>, which configures it for data
        exchange between an Amiga and a C64, so I decided to figure it out myself. I managed to set it up and can use
        the
        FTP client to transfer files or even browse the Gopherspace with a Gopher client that's using AmigaGuide. If
        you're interested how to configure it,
        see my <a href="a500-amiganos.html">AmigaNOS guide here</a>.</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure however that it's not what most people mean when they say they'd like to bring their Amiga 500
        online.</p>

      <p>So what's the <b>bare minimum</b> needed to be able to use the graphical Internet applications (or at least
        some of
        them), from an Amiga 500?</p>

      <p>You could have guessed it already:<br>Kickstart 2.0+, some extra memory and realistically, a hard drive.</p>

      <p>If you don't have a hard drive, you can try TermiteTCP, which runs from a single floppy. I prepared a disk for
        you, <a href="#termitetcp">see below</a>. But to run some applications along it like a web browser, you'll need
        more memory and a hard drive.</p>

      <p>My choice was a <a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=534">Commodore A590</a>,
        which was the official hard drive offering from Commodore for the Amiga 500.
        It's a SCSI controller with a maximum of 2MB extra memory expansion inside. There were other manufacturers who
        offered hard drives too, like AlfaData/BSC with their <a
          href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=522">AlfaPower 500</a>
        and GVP with the <a href="https://bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=1784">A500 HD+</a>. Today we
        also have the option
        to buy a new expansion board that has everything included, like an <a
          href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/shop/product/ACA500plus.html">ACA500+</a> with a <a
          href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/x-surf-500.html#filter=*">X-Surf 500</a> network
        card. But for me the
        appeal in all this was the challenge to make it work with original and authentic hardware, and find the most
        basic and authentic setup possible,
        so this guide tries to cover that scenario.</p>

      <p>The obvious question pops up, if we can use the <a
          href="https://www.cbmstuff.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=440">WiModem232 with a TCP/IP stack</a>. In theory, it
        should work with a PPP/SLIP connection, but in practice, I don't know of anyone who managed to make it work,
        including myself. If you do know someone, let me know!</p>

      <p>Before tackling the challenge on bringing the system online, we need to solve two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Transfering files to the Amiga</li>
        <li>Having a Kickstart 2.0+</li>
      </ol>

      <p>There are several options for both. But without an expansion board, your options are limited to either
        transfering
        files with the help of <a href="https://www.amigaforever.com/ae/">AmigaExplorer</a> via a null modem cable (<a
          href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/361535182471?hash=item542d2d1687:g:vHwAAOSwPc9WvI1U&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4DmH8PsioZg52l1kjzN2MLM0wVv%2BQx8qOA0wr%2Bi6L%2BCEicN9jkMJjUD9WsB%2F6jt63ns26oHbjMBD33xTtAHdYdN8kSIjHR2ySfkU3TItJGgQHDjD6%2BAFej1QaGlsG6B%2F%2Fd90AC2vSUDJkSkt%2B%2FI30GjFfZEgnD0Q5aHUg%2BP%2BIoRNaIj%2BbE34Yh9zIjbv%2BrQEPUwdVls540xrOIMprI8FzSqMVkFms0294y1i1kcWT8TxMrK%2FsW%2FJCCWXU7V2r%2Brp4JUm0vVdHr35jE%2FjUo2qK4o3y5OMVuuHRI46HObKuJm%2B%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR4DXtsvkYg">here</a>
        or <a href="https://amigastore.eu/en/275-cable-null-modem-amiga.html">here</a>) or with some compromise for a
        new hardware,
        with a <a href="https://amigastore.eu/en/323-usb-floppy-emulator-gotek.html">GOTEK floppy emulator</a>. There is
        also the SDBox (SD card reader for the Parallel port), but I haven't tried it, so I can't recommend it yet.
        I tried both the null modem cable and the GOTEK though, and can recommend going for both, as you'll need the
        null modem cable anyway, and having a GOTEK makes life so much easier (just think trying out new games and
        demos). I installed my GOTEK in an external floppy case, so it looks nice.</p>

      <p>Here is <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=15">AmigaLove's excellent guide on AmigaExplorer</a>
        and how to transfer files with a null modem cable. It was written for an Amiga 1200, but it works on Amiga 500
        as well.</p> But you can also do it with a <a href="a500-gotek-file-transfer.html">GOTEK drive by using an
        emulator</a>. Just insert an empty ADF into the emulator's virtual floppy drive and copy stuff on it, then copy
      the ADF image to your GOTEK's USB stick.

      <p>For the Kickstart, you also have two options. You can buy a new
        Kickstart ROM (there are <a
          href="https://sordan.ie/product/550/dual-double-kickstart-rom-13--31-amiga-500-600-2000-switcher/">DUAL
          ROMs</a> too, where you can switch between
        Kickstart 1.3 and 3.1 with a physical switch to keep your system backwards compatible), or you can load the new
        Kickstart from a file, by mapping it to a memory
        location (soft-kick). I wanted to keep the original 1.3 chip in my Amiga 500, so I took the
        soft-kick route. <a href="a500-soft-kick-dual-boot.html">Click here for a guide on how to set it up</a>, and
        optionally, how to make a
        dual-boot setup between Workbench 1.3 and 3.1.</p>

      <h3>Now finally,</h3>
      <p>Here is all that's needed to bring our Amiga 500 to the Internet:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>An Amiga 500 with at least an 512Kbyte memory expansion. Or more if you're taking the soft-kick route. You
          can also do a 1MB Chip RAM mod, if you have a Rev.6A motherboard with a Fat Agnus (8372A) chip, that supports
          1Mb Chip RAM.</li>
        <li>A way to transfer files between a PC and the Amiga (a GOTEK or a null modem cable and the AmigaExplorer
          software)</li>
        <li>Kickstart 2.0+</li>
        <li>A null modem cable to connect our Amiga to a PC which will act as a PPP server.</li>
        <li>A whatever PC running Linux</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Optional (but recommended):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A hard drive with some more extra memory (2MB will do) to install Workbench and applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="amiga-pc-ppp">Amiga-PC PPP config</h2>

      <p>On the PC side: I used a Raspberry Pi, which is always on and has a pppd running. It's connected to the Amiga
        via a
        NullModem cable and a serial to USB adapter. An older PC that has a 9-pin female serial port would also do the
        job and you can skip the adapter. But you can find serial to USB adapters all over eBay for a very low cost.</p>

      <p>On the Amiga side: The only thing we need is a TCP/IP stack and some applications. You'll see that's a
        challenge
        in itself, as most Internet applications barely work on a 68000 CPU and 2MB of RAM.</p>

      <h2>Configure the PC side</h2>
      <p>Let's prepare the PC side first. I was using Raspberry Pi OS Lite Bullseye:</p>

      <p>Install ppp if it isn't already present:</p>
      <pre>sudo apt install ppp</pre>

      <p>Enable IP forwarding:</p>
      <pre>sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"</pre>

      <p>Create a script that will set the Network Address Translation rules and start the ppp daemon:
      <p>
      <pre>nano start-amiga-ppp.sh</pre>
      <p>Paste the following to it:</p>
      <pre>#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Caution, the following two commands will clear all rules!
# Comment them out if you have rules already configured and you don't want that
        
sudo iptables -F
sudo iptables -t nat -F

      <h3 id="termitetcp">Floppy only systems</h3>
      <p>There is a lightweight TCP/IP stack called TermiteTCP by Oregon Research which comes with PPP support, although
        the demo on Aminet has PPP and bsdsocket.library support turned off, so it's pretty much useless, but as all
        Oregon Research products <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=54913">became public domain</a> more
        than 10 years ago, I dared to prepare a <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/03030b6077c3132475aa5980e57906d6068">floppy installation of TermiteTCP
          version 1.50</a>, which you can grab.</a> Here is the <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/030946fd41b4b424dc7b106f12a7a166b0b">TermiteTCP version 1.60 installer
          disk</a> too.

      <p>It's very easy to setup, although not very stable, so I can't really recommend it. It was dropping the
        connection after a few minutes despite increasing the connection timeout and verification interval, but if you
        want to play around with it, here is how I set it up:</p>

      <p>Launch TermiteTCP68k and open the connection settings from the menu. You can leave most things at default here,
        just make sure it matches the pppd settings on your PC's side:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/termitetcp_01.gif"></p>

      <p>Open the network settings. Set the local IP to 10.0.0.2 (amiga), remote to 10.0.0.1 (pc), the DNS server to
        your router's IP, which is 192.168.10.1 in my case. You can set the alternate DNS to 10.0.0.1 (pc) and pick a
        default domain, I typed just a500 there. </p>
      <p><img src="../images/termitetcp_02.gif"></p>

      <p>Click connect. TermiteTCP will ask if you want a direct serial connection, say Yes.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/termitetcp_03.gif"></p>

      <p>That's it, you're online. You can use the FTP or Telnet client provided on the disk to connect to the outside
        world.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/termitetcp_04.gif"></p>

      <p>Unfortunately you can't run a web browser without a hard drive, as all graphical browsers require either
        ClassAct or MUI and several libraries to be installed (even <a
          href="https://www.jottacloud.com/s/0305741f9c5c71349f89ecde84dfbbd2d24">AMosaic</a> needs MUI).</p>

      <h3>With a hard drive</h3>

      <p>Now you have more options. <a href="a500-soft-kick-dual-boot.html">Boot into Workbench 3.1</a> and have an <a
          href="http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/lha">Lha</a> utility at hand.</p>

      <p>I went with the demo version of the Miami 3.0b TCP/IP stack, as I used it back in the day, it has PPP support
        built-in (as opposed to AmiTCP) and can be configured easily from GUI. The demo version lets you stay online for
        60 minutes, which is enough for this test and casual use. Unfortunately there is no way to obtain the Miami
        license from legal sources, but if you want to try a TCP/IP stack that's still supported, <a
          href="http://roadshow.apc-tcp.de/index-en.php">RoadShow</a> is available from APC&TCP for 25 EUR, and it runs
        on 68000 and has PPP support built-in also. I haven't tried it, but might give it a go later.</p>

      <p>Install the following stuff and their dependencies on your Amiga if you don't have them already:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Miami3.0b (<a href="http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/Miami32b2-main">main archive</a> and <a
            href="http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/Miami32b-000">68000 archive</a>, install it with the GTLayout GUI,
          which is more lightweight than MUI)</li>
        <li><a href="http://aminet.net/comm/misc/baudbandit1.4b.lha">Baudbandit 1.4b</a> (you can get higher speeds by
          replacing the original serial.device)</li>
        <li><a href="http://aminet.net/comm/tcp/AmiFTP.lha">AmiFTP</a> (free and lighter than AmFTP, but requires <a
            href="http://aminet.net/util/libs/mui38usr.lha">MUI</a> and <a
            href="http://aminet.net/util/libs/ReqToolsUsr.lha">ReqTools</a>)</li>
        <li>AWeb 3.5.09-68000 (<a href="http://aminet.net/comm/www/aweb_3_5_091.lha">main archive</a> and <a
            href="http://aminet.net/comm/www/AWeb-3.5.09-68000.lha">68000 archive</a>, requires <a
            href="http://aminet.net/dev/gui/ClassAct2Demo.lha">ClassAct</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="http://aminet.net/comm/www/Voyager.lha">Voyager 2.70</a> (another web browser, nicer than AWeb, but
          requires MUI.)</li>
        <li><a href="http://aminet.net/package/comm/irc/amirc_362_68000">AmIRC 3.6.2</a> (68000 version, but you might
          also want to look into older AmIRC versions that are faster)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Configure Miami PPP connection</h4>
      <p>Open the interface settings and set it up like this. Using built in serial PPP/CSLIP, Baud 19200 (same that you
        set in pppd on the PC side), static IP address 10.0.0.2 (the Amiga 500's IP):</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_01.gif"></p>

      <p>Go to the TCP/IP settings and set the hostname, real name, username, leave everything else unchecked:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_02.gif"></p>

      <p>In the Modem settings and check the NullModem option:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_03.gif"></p>

      <p>The PPP settings remain default, it looks like this:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_04.gif"></p>

      <p>Open the Database settings and select the DNS Servers option in the Network Database. Then click Add and enter
        your router's local address, which is in my case 192.168.10.1 and also the PC's address which we configured to
        10.0.0.1 in the pppd settings:</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_05.gif"></p>

      <p>That's all there is to it, save the configuration as default from the menu, and you're ready to test it. Click
        Online and hope for the best. If you did everything right, it should go online. You can open a new CLI window,
        go to miami: and check if ping works to 10.0.0.1, then to an external address by typing:</p>
      <pre>miamiping www.google.com</pre>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ping.gif"></p>

      <p>If everything works well, you can try out the BaudBandit device to get higher speeds. First, install BaudBandit
        on your Amiga. Then, set a higher baud rate in the pppd on the PC side (57600 for example) and restart the
        service. In Miami, open the Interface settings, change the interface type to "serial driver" and type in
        BaudBandit.device (pay attention to upper and lower cases, it's case sensitive!). Set the speed to the same you
        set in pppd, the flow control to RTS/CTS (same as in pppd), and serial mode 81N. All the rest is the same as
        before.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/miami_ppp_06.gif"></p>

      <p>On my system (1MB Chip RAM, 2MB Other RAM), I have 3-400Kbyte free memory after launching either AWeb or
        Voyager (while Miami is online with the GUI closed). It's possible to open a simple website though! Aminet and
        Frogfind.com works just fine. Getting a physical dual Kickstart ROM would help a bit, saving another 0.5MB of
        memory, but forget about pages that are image heavy or require SSL, that's way over the capabilities of this
        setup. It's painfully slow and not what this machine was intended for, but it works! If you want to visit sites
        that are forcing https (most sites do today), you can install a <a
          href="../bluescsiv2-dayna.html#webone">WebOne proxy</a> on your Linux machine along the
        pppd, which can convert all https traffic to http and do other cool things to make the modern web more
        accessible from your Amiga.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/voyager.gif"></p>

      <p>With BaudBandit you can go up to 57600 baud speed on a 4 color screen, so I've been using that for FTP
        transfers. It doesn't work on a 16 color screen though (starts to drop packages), so you have to choose between
        speed or a more "colorful" browsing experience.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/amiftp.gif"></p>

      <p>What am I using all this for then? Chatting with friends on IRC brings back memories, and it's nice to be able
        to get software from Aminet or other places. I have an FTP server on my RaspberryPi for easy file exchange, and
        I can also backup files from the Amiga to the FTP. All the WB3.1 screenshots in this guide were grabbed on my
        Amiga (with <a href="http://aminet.net/package/util/cdity/CRSnap">CRSnap</a>) and transferred this way.</p>

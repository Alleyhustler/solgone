      <h1>Mcbazel ODV-GBS-C scan converter and ODV-II Composite/CVBS/S-Video adapter review</h1>

      <p>There are several upscalers and adapters on the market that make it possible to connect old computers and video
        game systems to modern TVs. I decided to buy the <a href="https://www.odv-gbsc.com/">Mcbazel ODV-GBS-C</a> scan
        converter and upscaler with an <a
          href="https://www.flashbackltd.com/products/odv-ii-component-cvbs-s-video-to-component-converter-for-retro-gaming-console">ODV-II
          Composite adapter</a>. They can be found at several retailers, I decided to go with Amazon Sweden for the
        quick shipping and no import tax. My choice was motivated by the number of features and connectivity options,
        availability and the reasonable cost.</p>

      <p>I have several systems with different outputs, that I wanted to be able to connect to my TV, which happens to
        have only HDMI inputs. I have a Sega MegaDrive and a Nintendo GameCube with HD Retrovision SCART cables, a
        Nintendo Wii with a component cable, a Commodore 64 that has a composite output (or S-Video at best) and a
        Commodore Amiga that outputs RGB via a SCART cable.
        This setup covers all of them.</p>

      <h2>ODV-GBS-C</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ramapcsx2/gbs-control">GBS-Control</a> is an open source project to modify and
        improve the Tvia Trueview5725 based GBS8200 upscaler, which was used in some arcade machines and make it into a
        generic and awesome upscaler for retro gaming.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-3.jpg"></p>

      <p>It features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>very low lag</li>
        <li>sharp and defined upscaling, comparing well to other expensive units</li>
        <li>no synchronization loss switching 240p/480i (output runs independent from input, sync to display never drops
          as opposed to OSSC)</li>
        <li>on demand motion adaptive deinterlacer that engages automatically and only when needed</li>
        <li>works with almost anything: 8 bit consoles, 16/32 bit consoles, 2000s consoles, home computers, etc</li>
        <li>control interface via web browser (creates a WIFI hotspot)</li>
        <li>good color reproduction with auto gain and auto offset for the tripple 8 bit @ 160MHz ADC</li>
        <li>optional bypass capability to, for example, transcode Component to RGB/HV in high quality</li>
        <li>downscaling, to display modern systems on older screens and CRTs (HD to 240p)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>ODV stands for Original Draw Video and it's the branding used by the chinese manufacturer Mcbazel, that made an
        end-user product from the open source project. But of course, you can build your own if you want to. They also
        make a composite adapter with the name ODV-II composite, in the same orange case design, which can be used to
        add the missing composite input option to the GBS-C (or any other upscaler for that matter).</p>

      <p>Let's see what's in the box and set it up:</p>

      <p><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-4.jpg"></p>

      <p>The unit itself looks well built, the plastic is decent quality and they even added rubber feet to both the
        ODV-GBS-C and the ODV-II composite adapter.</p>

      <p><a href="../images/odv-gbsc-2.jpg"><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-2s.jpg"></a></p>

      <p>There is a VGA pass connector and a SCART connector in the front of the unit, with a 3 state selector switch
        that lets you choose the type of the input coming from the SCART connector, between YPBPR/VGA/RGBS, RGBS or
        RGsB. On the left side the component video and audio input RCA jacks, on the right side the DC power and
        micro-USB power connectors can be found. The back side of the unit features a VGA out and a HDMI out port, along
        with a 3.5mm audio out jack. The GBS-C requires more power than what my Samsung TV provides, so it has to be
        powered either by it's own power supply or a USB power supply.</p>

      <p>The setup is very straightforward, just plug in the power, connect the TV to the HDMI port and your equipment
        to any of the inputs. Then turn the unit on. The ODV-GBS-C auto detects the input. It has an LCD screen and some
        control nobs you can play around with. You can fine tune the color saturation with the RGB nobs and move around
        the menu and select (press) with the fourth nob.</p>

      <p><a href="../images/ODV_GBS-C_PCB.jpg"><img src="../images/ODV_GBS-C_PCBs.jpg"></a></p>


      <p>The menu is simple. It allows you to select an output resolution, load a predefined preset, do a factory
        reset/restart and view the current output settings. The more advanced settings are in the web UI.</p>

      <p>The GBS-C provides a WIFI hotspot where it's configuration interface can be reached. It appears as
        <b>gbscontrol</b> in your network list. The default <b>password is “qqqqqqqq”</b>. Once you're connected, open a
        browser and a navigate to <b>192.168.4.1</b></p>

      <p>Here you can create, modify and delete presets, align and scale the image to fit (if needed), enable scanline
        emulation and fine tune some more advanced stuff. The UI provides a good explanation of all options if you click
        on the question mark.</p>
      <div class="image-row">
        <a href="../images/odv-gbsc-5.jpg"><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-5s.jpg"></a><a
          href="../images/odv-gbsc-6.jpg"><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-6s.jpg"></a><a
          href="../images/odv-gbsc-7.jpg"><img src="../images/odv-gbsc-7s.jpg"></a>
      </div>
      <p>The scanline emulation allows for different strengths of scanlines and some other fine tuning like subtle
        sharpening of lines. I kept coming back to the lightest scanline option, as for me it made the low res images
        much more pleasant to view on the huge screen. The scanline emulation works with 240p inputs only and is
        automatically turned off for the more modern, higher resolution inputs.</p>

      <p>The only setting I changed (turned on, it's off by default) in the advanced panel was the FrameTime Lock. It
        keeps the input and output timings aligned, fixing the horizontal tear line (raster line) that can sometimes
        appear.</p>

      <p>My first impression is that the image looks great. I tested it with a Sega Mega Drive 1 (HD retrovision SCART
        cable), a Nintendo GameCube (AV output with a HD retrovision SCART CSYNC cable), an Amiga 500 with an RGB-SCART
        cable, a Nintendo Wii with a component cable, and a Commodore 64 using the ODV-II composite-to-component
        adapter, connecting the C64 with a composite cable. In most cases upscaling to 1080p or 1280/960 gave the best
        result and what my Samsung TV could handle.</p>

      <p>I've been running it for about an hour during my test, the unit got warm, but not really hot. The image is
        sharp and clear, the colors seem correct, the scrolling is smooth, there is no raster line after turning on the
        FrameTime lock and I couldn't notice any input lag. The only issue I discovered was with the Wii, where with the
        interlaced resolutions the screen sometimes went black for a second. It doesn't happen in 480p though. I
        probably I need to play around with the settings to solve that. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase so
        far.</p>

      <p>Here are some screenshots with the various inputs, with scanline emulation enabled and disabled:</p>

      <h2 id="odvii">ODV-II Composite/CVBS/S-Video adapter</h2>

      <p>This small adapter lets you connect composite sources to the scan converter. It's USB 5V powered and can run
        from your TV's powered USB port, if it has one. It runs just fine from my Samsung TV's USB port which provides
        1A. There are 3 buttons, a Power On/OFF switch, an Input selection and a Fuction selection button. The input
        selection switches between the Y/PB/PR, CVBS and S-Video inputs, while the Funtion selection toggles between
        smoothing/video-fiter options, which I found quite useless.</p>

      <p><img src="../images/odv-ii-2.jpg"></p>

      <p>I tested the adapter with a Commodore 64, with a regular composite cable. The CVBS RCA jack went into the
        ODV-II, the L/R audio jacks into the ODV-GBS-C. I was pleased with the result. The image was good enough for
        enjoying some games and the text was readable. For a better image quality I will buy an S-Video cable for the
        C64 eventually.</p>

      <p><a href="../images/odv-ii-3.jpg"><img src="../images/odv-ii-3s.jpg"></a></p>

      <p>One thing that could have been improved in the design that the order of the component out RCA jacks on the
        ODV-II and the component input RCA jacks on the GBS-C could have been mirrored, so they could be connected via a
        male-male RCA plug instead of a cable, "tying" the two units together to reduce some cabling clutter.</p>

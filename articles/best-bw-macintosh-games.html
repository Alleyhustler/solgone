      <h1>The Best B&W Macintosh Games</h1>

      <p>Here is my personal Top 20 List (and number of honorable mentions in an alphabetical order) of the finest
        vintage Macintosh games.
      <p>
      <p>Some aged better than the others, so I tried to focus on ones that stood the test of time and are still
        enjoyable or worth to play today, but also pick from a wide variety of genres for both casual and more hardcore
        players.</p>
      <p>If you own a vintage compact Mac and want to slow down and explore the early days of computer games, give these
        a try.</p>


      <h2 id="14">20. Dark Castle</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/darkcastle.gif">
      <p>Genre: Platform<br>
        Year: 1986<br>
        Publisher: Silicon Beach Software<br>
        Compatibility: System 1 - System 5<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/dark-castle" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>A famous platform game on the Mac, where the player taking the role of a young hero, has to find the way
        through the rooms of a Dark Castle and defeat the evil Black Knight. The game has one of the best looking B&W
        graphics on vintage Macs and a great use of digitized sound effects. It's a very challenging game though (even
        on the beginner difficulty), filled with traps, enemies and puzzle elements. Prepare to die quickly. But
        unfortunately the biggest challenge is to launch it, as it crashes on everything above System 5. The best is to
        boot it from floppy. If you're running it in an emulator, use Mini vMac and drag the Unlocked disk image into
        the emulator's window. On the starting screen where you have to select a door, use the number keys (1, 2..).</p>

      <h2 id="20">19. Defender of the Crown</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/defenderofthecrown.gif">
      <p>Genre: Strategy<br>
        Year: 1987<br>
        Publisher: Cinemaware<br>
        Compatibility: System 1 - System 6<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/defender-of-the-crown" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a>
      </p>

      <p>A medieval strategy game originally released on the Commodore Amiga in 1986 and ported to Macintosh in 1987. It
        set a new standard in computer game graphics. After the death of the king, different factions fight for the
        throne. The player assumes the role of a Saxon and must fight the Normans and compete against other rival lords.
        The game is map based and has several arcade mini-games (capturing the castle, fighting in tournaments, etc).
        The Macintosh version features more in-depth strategic elements compared to the original version and has very
        nice graphics despite it being 1-bit. Runs up to System 6 (it crashes at different points on newer systems). In
        2002 a <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/defender-of-the-crown-digitally-remastered-edition"
          target="_blank">remastered edition</a> was released that runs on MacOS 8.1 and 9.</p>

      <h2 id="19">18. Hellcats: Over the Pacific</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/hellcats.gif">
      <p>Genre: Simulation<br>
        Year: 1991<br>
        Publisher: Graphic Simulations<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/hellcats-over-the-pacific" target="_blank">Macintosh
          Garden</a></p>

      <p>Hellcats is a flight combat simulator with 3D graphics taking place in the WWII era. The player is piloting a
        Grumman F6F Hellcat airplane and has to complete land and flight carrier based missions with guns and bombs. It
        requires at least 2MB RAM and a 68020 processor, but runs fine in B&W. The game was a huge hit and it won
        several awards like the "Best Simulation Game" of MacWorld.</p>

      <h2 id="18">17. Cyberblast</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/cyberblast.gif">
      <p>Genre: Action, shooter<br>
        Year: 1992<br>
        Publisher: Innerprise Software, Inc.<br>
        Compatibility: System 7 - 7.6<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/cyberblast" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Cyberblast is a Gauntlet clone (see honorable mentions), a top-down shooter, where the player races against
        time and must make it through 64 different levels filled with enemies, collect crystals, ID-cards, extra
        weapons, etc, until he can find the missing control chip and and stop the crazy portal experiment that
        threathens our solar system. There are two characters with different abilities and limitations to select from.
        Even though the game was released the Amiga as well, the Macintosh version has a faster paced gameplay. It
        requires at least a 68020 CPU and System 7 however.</p>

      <h2 id="17">16. Lemmings</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/lemmings.gif">
      <p>Genre: Puzzle<br>
        Year: 1991<br>
        Publisher: Psygnosis<br>
        Compatibility: System - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/lemmings-oh-no-more-lemmings" target="_blank">Macintosh
          Garden</a></p>

      <p>Fast paced puzzle game where you have to save the lemmings through 120 different levels, using various
        abilities like drilling, climbing, gliding, building bridges, etc. The game has been ported to countless
        platforms, the B&W Mac version is obviously not being the nicest, but it's still great and an all-time classic!
      </p>

      <h2 id="16">15. Continuum</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/continuum.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade, Shooter<br>
        Year: 1987<br>
        Publisher: The Wilson Brothers<br>
        Compatibility: System 1-7 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/prince-of-persia" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Asteroids like shooter in a maze. You turn your ship, can apply thrust and use your shield or lasers to get
        through the various levels. It also features a level editor. The difficulty level can be frustrating at times,
        but it's still very well done and one of the best shooters available for vintage Macs.</p>

      <h2 id="15">14. ZOA: Zone of Avoidance</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/zoa.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade, Shooter<br>
        Year: 1993<br>
        Publisher: Casady & Greene<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - 7.6<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/zoa-the-zone-of-avoidance" target="_blank">Macintosh
          Garden</a></p>

      <p>This is a great space shooter with fast 3D graphics. The space station orbiting a planet is under attack by
        aliens and you're the only one who can stop them. The ship is controlled by the mouse and the game works nice in
        B&W. I would recommend it to anyone who has a slightly faster vintage Mac and likes 3D shooters, it's a well
        done game and still enjoyable today.</p>

      <h2 id="13">13. Loom</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/loom.gif">
      <p>Genre: Adventure<br>
        Year: 1990<br>
        Publisher: LucasArts<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/loom" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Exceptionally well programmed fantasy point'n'click adventure game, that runs on almost all vintage Mac
        systems, in either B&W or 16 color mode. It features a unique concept of no inventory or items to carry around.
        The player manipulates the objects on screen by interacting with them and uses spells, which most of the puzzles
        in the game are built on. It also has three difficulty levels to choose from, affecting the interface, how many
        names and marks are displayed.</p>

      <h2 id="12">12. Crystal Quest</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/crystalquest.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade Shooter<br>
        Year: 1987<br>
        Publisher: Casady & Greene<br>
        Compatibility: System 1 - System 7<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/crystal-quest" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>A space shooter where you control a strange round ship (ball?) and have to collect all crystals on the screen
        for the exit to open, while enemies enter from different directions. You can also shoot in the direction you're
        going. Fast paced, addictive and supports both B&W and color mode. It won MacWorld's best action game of 1988.
      </p>

      <h2 id="11">11. Oregon Trail</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/oregontrail.gif">
      <p>Genre: Simulation<br>
        Year: 1992<br>
        Publisher: MEEC (Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium)<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-oregon-trail" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>An educational simulation game with the intention to teach the history and realities of the emigration that
        took place in 19th century along the 3490 km long wagon route in the United States. The first version of the
        game was developed in 1971 and it was a text based. The 1992 Macintosh version features nice B&W graphics and
        animations and an engaging gameplay. The player can choose a starting character profession (banker, carpenter,
        or farmer), which determines the amount of money the party will have and thus the difficulty of the adventure.
        The player travelling through the trail will encounter dangers (bandits, snakes, etc), get through rivers with
        the caravan, repair the wagons, deal with the weather and illnesses, hunt for food and trade in cities. One of
        the most well known and iconic vintage Macintosh games, a must play.</p>

      <h2 id="10">10. Pipe Dream</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/pipedream.gif">
      <p>Genre: Puzzle<br>
        Year: 1989<br>
        Publisher: Lucasfilm Games<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 8.1<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/pipe-dream" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Also known as Pipe Mania in the EU, is an arcade style puzzle game where you must build a pipe system from the
        given pipe shapes quickly before and while the water starts flowing. It's a race against time, thinking ahead,
        to build a pipe long enough with corners and junctions so that you get enough points to reach the next level.
        Full screen, good graphics, with fun music and sound effects. Simple, but very challenging puzzle game.</p>

      <h2 id="9">9. Arkanoid</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/arkanoid.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade<br>
        Year: 1988<br>
        Publisher: Taito<br>
        Compatibility: System 2 - System 6<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/arkanoid" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>An absolute classic breakout game that makes the original much more fun by reimagining the bat as a spaceship
        and adding power-ups like lasers, a catching device and slow down, to make the gameplay more arcade like. The
        game has very nice B&W graphics, animations and digital sound effects. It uses a framebuffer, which can have
        issues if there are many memory residents running, so in case it complains, try to launch it from a minimal
        System 6 installation, or boot it from floppy.</p>

      <h2 id="8">8. Sim City</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/simcity.gif">
      <p>Genre: Simulation, Strategy<br>
        Year: 1989<br>
        Publisher: Maxis<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/simcity" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>I guess I don't need to introduce this one. The father of all open-ended strategic simulation games. The very
        first in the "Sims" series. Become the major of an existing city and help to make it prosper, or build your
        dream city from the ground up. Manage the infrastructure and ecomony and deal with natural disasters like
        floods, fires, earthquakes, etc. Such a timeless concept and game, that it's a must have if you like the genre.
      </p>

      <h2 id="7">7. ShufflePuck Cafe</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/shufflepuckcafe.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade, Sport<br>
        Year: 1988<br>
        Publisher: Broderbund<br>
        Compatibility: System 1 - 7<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/shufflepuck-cafe" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Air hockey game with the atmosphere of the cantina from Star Wars. The player can choose an opponent from
        various alien creatures with different difficulty levels and play styles. Some of them can be very challening,
        so it's worth to try playing with changing some of the paddle parameters like sideways and forward bounce and
        power, size, etc. You can also add a moving brick in the middle of the field as an extra twist. I played this
        game during countless of school breaks in the computer room, and loved the atmosphere and the animations. It
        runs perfectly on my Mac Classic II with System 7.0.1. An interesting addition is that there was an unofficial
        version of the game that contained mild nudity, where Princess Bejin exposes her breast when she raises her
        hand. This version became so widespread that many belived that it was a feature of the original.</p>

      <h2 id="6">6. Test Drive II: The Duel</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/testdrive2.gif">
      <p>Genre: Racing, Simulation<br>
        Year: 1989<br>
        Publisher: Accolade<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - System 7.6<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-duel-test-drive-ii" target="_blank">Macintosh
          Garden</a></p>

      <p>Probably the best car driving simulator on vintage Macs. You race supercars like the Ferrari F40 or the Porsche
        959 against the clock or a computer opponent on various tracks, while avoiding the police and keeping track when
        to stop for refuel. There were extension disks for more cars (muscle cars and super cars disk) and more
        sceneries as well (California and European challenge). The game has very nice graphics and on faster machines
        (like the SE/30 or the Classic II) runs very smoothly. Even though it was released on many other platforms, I
        think the Macintosh version was done well and is still very much enjoyable.</p>

      <h2 id="5">5. Glider 4.0</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/glider4.gif">
      <p>Genre: Arcade, Casual<br>
        Year: 1991<br>
        Publisher: Soft Dorothy Software<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 8.1<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/glider-40" target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Fly a paperplane across the house, catch the warm air to give you a lift, but avoid the obstacles and dangers.
        Arcade game requiring good timing skills with a non-violent and addictive gameplay. Many side-scrolling rooms to
        explore, multiple directions to go, lots of creative ideas and fun animations, extendable with new levels and
        comes with a level designer included. Macintosh original, a true classic.</p>

      <h2 id="4">4. Pools of Darkness</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/poolsofdarkness.gif">
      <p>Genre: Role playing<br>
        Year: 1992<br>
        Publisher: Strategic Simulations Inc.<br>
        Compatibility: System 6 - MacOS 9<br>
        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-duel-test-drive-ii" target="_blank">Macintosh
          Garden</a></p>

      <p>It's a role playing game set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, with a dungeon crawler and isometric
        turn-based battle mechanic. It's the fourth and final entry of the Pool of Radiance series, but the story is
        playable in itself. Set in the Forgotten Realms, the player has to stop an evil god from invading the land of
        Phlan, travelling between dimensions, fighting his minions. There is a pre-designed party, but you can also
        create your own. Originally released for MS-DOS and then the Amiga, I think the Macintosh version is what makes
        the most out of this engine and the 'cutscenes' feature some gorgeous 1-bit graphics. During the combat the
        player goes one by one through characters, assigning them various commands. The battles are challenging, you
        must really think how you fight. The game comes on two floppies, one for the B&W and one for the Color graphics.
      </p>

      <h2 id="3">3. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/indy3.gif">
      <p>Genre: Adventure<br>
        Year: 1990<br>

        Download: <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/games/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade"
          target="_blank">Macintosh Garden</a></p>

      <p>Point'n'click adventure game, using the SCUMM engine. It mostly follows the story of the film, with lots of
        places to visit, puzzles to solve and jokes to laugh at. It has both 16 color and B&W support, with nicely done
        B&W graphics (as opposed to most Sierra games, where the B&W mode was best effort) and an engaging gameplay with
        sane and logical puzzles. There are multiple ways to solve them too, which give the game some replay value. I
        would argue that this is the best point'n'click adventure game on B&W Macs.</p>


      <h2 id="2">2. Prince of Persia</h2>
      <img src="../images/games/princeofpersia.gif">

      <p>An iconic platform game and one of the first games to use a cinematic style animation. The game combines run &
        jump platform mechanics with areas requiring careful steps and enemies with a sword fighting combat. Jaffar
        wants to marry the princess but she refuses. He gives her 60 minutes to change her mind or die. The protagonist,
        whom the princess loves, is thrown into prison. He must get out and rescue the princess before the time runs
        out. I've spend countless of hours trying to beat the game with my friends in our school. The B&W Macintosh
        version looks fantastic and is a joy to play even today.</p>

      <p>The original version of the world famous Tetris game, an absolute classic and a masterpiece. It features
        everything that made this game so great. Challenging puzzle, good music and graphics (the background images
        change as you level up), and that "it takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master." A must have.</p>

          <p>It was so exciting back then to see chess coming to life! Battle Chess is technically a conventional chess
            game, with animated pieces. Every piece has a different animation and battle style, depending on whom they
            fight with. There are 10 skills levels and an option to switch to a 2D board without animations (even during
            play). If you like chess, you have to try this. If you don't, still do because the animations are so funny.

          <p>The Colony is probably among the very first real time FPS games, that allow the player to move freely. The
            player takes the role of the commander of a spaceship, who receives a distress signal and while
            investigating it, crash lands on a planet. You must explore the colony, repair your ship and eventually stop
            the invasion of an alien race. The game is mouse controlled (3D movement and interaction with objects),
            which can be frustrating at times, but nonetheless a very impressive game that was ahead of it's time.</p>

          <p>An unconventional point'n'click adventure game intended for smaller children, based on Hypercard, from the
            creators who later worked on Myst. The game has no goal and no scoring or inventory system. It focuses on

          <p>Formula One racing game, presumably using the same engine as Test Drive (released the same year). The game
            features 8 tracks and 3 different cars (Ferrari, McLaren, Williams) to choose from. You have to run a
            qualifying race first, then race against opponents, but be careful, the car can crash. A very enjoyable
            racing game, that runs smooth on faster B&W Macs.</p>

          <p>Similar in concept to Shufflepuck Cafe (which this game predates), where you start from a Star Wars like
            cantina to pick your alien opponents, but the game itself is very different. It feels like a mash up of
            Space Invaders, Centipede and Tetris. The opponent builds blocks the player must shoot before they reach the
            other side. There is also a shield for each row which wears down from bouncing objects. Interesting concept
            and a very fun game. The disk contains a minimal System and boots from floppy.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Also known as Might and Magic Book Two. It's a battle focused role-playing game, with turn based combat.
            The player creates a party with up to six characters from 8 classes (Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric,
            Sorcerer, Robber, Barbarians and Ninjas) and adventures through the land of CRON. The game improves on the
            first one on many ways, nicer graphics, easier navigation and gameplay elements like a "delay" selector,
            which allowed for faster or slower response times and a spinning icon to notify when input from the player
            is required. It runs in a small window, but features nice graphics and a dungeon crawler mechanics with a
            fast paced gameplay.</p>

          <p>It's an unusual sport game, where two players compete in a parabolic arena, flying on hoverboards, trying
            to score a ball into the goals on the sides. You can gather a momentum and toss the other player out, but
            you must be careful not to kick the ball out as that gives penalties. With having only a mouse control
            option, it's not an easy game to play, you need to get the hang of it.</p>

          <h2 id="29">Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel</h2>
          <img src="../images/games/policequest.gif">
          <p>Genre: Adventure<br>

          <p>Police Quest is a more serious take on adventure games from Sierra, that revolves around regular police
            work. Investigate crime scenes, following duty procesures, and eventually stopping a drug gang ruining the
            city. There is less focus on traditional puzzle elements and more on figuring out the right procedures (like
            you have to pull your gun before firing, or you will shoot yourself, or you have to check the police car
            before getting in, etc). Despite it has a command line interface, the story is very engaging. I played
            through the Amiga version, which is closer to the color Macintosh version and it's one of my favourite
            adventure games. The game is playable in B&W too, but unfortunately just like with Leisure Suite Larry, you
            can feel on it that the graphics wasn't optimized for it.</p>

          <p>WWII combat tank simulator, where you can pilot several different tanks against the German forces. You can
            control just one tank or several in formation, playing a tactics. You have to separately control the
            movement of the tank and the turrent, assuming both roles. The game features diverse missions, a training
            mode, a decent amount of realism and nice B&W graphics and sounds.</p>

          <p>The game combines point'n'click and text adventure elements. The mouse is used for moving around, but text
            commands are used to interact with objects. It also has some arcade mini-games like Astro Chicken (think
            Lunar Lander) and ship-to-ship combat. The game takes place in a world which feels like a parody of Star
            Wards and Star Trek, and continues the story of Roger Wilco, who while drifting in space in hibernation,
            gets picked up by a garbage freighter. It has a much nicer graphics compared to other B&W Sierra titles. If
            you've trouble starting the game, try the SQ3 Patch 1 by Enrico Zoxx, which makes it work on newer systems.

          <p>Macintosh port of the original 1983 arcade Star Wars game. You control an X-Wing during the battle at the
            Death Star and have to shoot down the Tie Fighters. The game is mouse controlled and has a simple vector
            graphics. Simple and fun, runs well on all vintage Macs.</p>

          <p>Originally developed for Apple II and MS-DOS, later ported to many other platforms. An 'adult' comedy
            graphic adventure game, following a middle-aged guy named Larry, trying to get laid. He is still a virgin,
            living with his mother, and decides to visit the city of Lost Wages to try his luck in finding the woman of
            his dreams. The game is controlled with the mouse (movement) and a text parser go give commands and interact
            (talk to man, open window, etc). Even though the Macintosh version doesn't look that nice graphically, it's
            a must have for anyone owning a B&W Mac and being interested in the genre and the history of point'n'click
            adventure games.</p>
